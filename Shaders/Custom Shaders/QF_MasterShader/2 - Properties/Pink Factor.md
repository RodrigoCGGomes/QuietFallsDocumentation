Pink Factor is a customizable material property designed to enhance the visual appeal of materials with a stylized, fleshy aesthetic. It achieves this by integrating a custom gradient that introduces a subtle pinkish blur in the transitional area between diffuse light and shadow. This effect adds a soft, organic look, making it ideal for character skins or other organic surfaces in Quiet Falls.
