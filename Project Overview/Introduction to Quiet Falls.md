*Quiet Falls* is a cozy farming/life simulator currently being developed by solo developer [[Rodrigo Gomes]]

## Art style and look
The game has a colorful but pastel look to it. Character traces are heavily influenced by Japanese Manga and anime style. Materials strive for a hand painted look. Custom shaders like the [[QF_MasterShader (Shader Documentation)|Quiet Falls Master Shader]] help boost the ambient colors and make the characters skin look fleshy with the Pinkness attribute

## Main Character ([[Narrator]])
In Quiet Falls, you control a fully customizable character. The main character's design is androgynous, allowing players to create a female or male character by selecting feminine or masculine hairstyles, clothing, and other features.
