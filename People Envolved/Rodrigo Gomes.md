I am the Author of QuietFalls, Rodrigo Gomes. I am currently a 3D artist and hobbyist programmer.
When I was a kid, I would play `Harvestmoon : A Wonderful Life`, and those times were great.
Since then I always had the idea of creating a game that would capture that feeling.
This idea became Quiet Falls. 

## Coding Background
It all started in 2010, when back then I had the idea of creating a harvestmoon-like game. I already knew what was 3d modeling, and had tried downloading software like Butterfly 3D, but the interface was scary and I never managed to do much in it.

Some time later, I learned about blender and in my first day using blender I modeled a cup. This video is still up on youtube in my first youtube channel.
