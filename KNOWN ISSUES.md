* [[QF_MasterShader (Shader Documentation)|Master Shader]] Glitches when the shader expects to use shadows due to the 'MATERIAL_QUALITY' keyword being medium or high but shadows are disabled in the Directional light.
* Many shaders are starting to use the Master Shader as a base, but for now I'm duplicating the nodes for all the shaders that want to use the Master Shader look. I need to port the master shader to a modular way of doing it using sub shaders, but there are some issues using the Cyanliux's URP_ShaderGraphCustomLighting's light calculations.
* The code logic lacks composition pattern. For instance, I should not be writing the camera orbit logic into the ThirdPersonCamera script. That should be a modular system to be instanced as a variable in all of the places where I want an orbit logic to be present.
